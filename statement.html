    <h1>Artist Statment</h1>
    <p>During the process of studying to be a professional artist, I have realized more and more how essential art is to my life. The drawings, prints, and paintings that I make serve as time capsules for the stories I want to tell. Relationships between memories and the spaces where these events take place are often lost or kept hidden away within the individual. All my life, I have found it difficult to communicate my own thoughts and feelings. My brain is often in silence and I am left with the most basic senses: the feelings in my gut, the way I see items placed in a scene, the sounds I hear buzzing in my ears. </p>

    <p>I believe that the simple items lying around us are more than inanimate objects. The spaces we fill can tell stories of the past and the present. I inject my own emotions and feelings brought on by personal experiences into still lives and landscapes in hopes to have the audience feel these same lingering emotions. My work explores the personal connections humans make with objects and situations, in order to jumpstart an inner dialogue.  </p>
